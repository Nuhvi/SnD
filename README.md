## Recommendations

### Byte alignment

For binary formats that require non-byte alignment you might need to control the byte length of the first line, for example, if the data format is an array of `u64`, you should prepend `%20` (space) characters before the `\n` (newline) to round the first line's byte length to the nearest multiple of 8 bytes.
